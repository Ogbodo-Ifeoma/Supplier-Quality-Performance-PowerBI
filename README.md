# Supplier-Quality-Performance-PowerBI

This project was developed for **Enterprise Manufacturers Ltd**, a company facing challenges in managing supplier quality due to a lack of a centralized procurement system. The goal of the project was to consolidate data from various plants, vendors, and materials, and provide insights into supplier performance. Using Power BI, the report visualizes key metrics such as defect quantity, downtime caused by defective materials, and overall vendor and plant performance.

### Key Questions Addressed:
- Which vendors/plants are causing the greatest defect quantity?
- Which vendors/plants are causing the greatest downtime?
- Is there a particular combination of material and vendor that performs poorly?
- Is there a particular combination of vendor and plant that performs poorly?
- How does the same vendor and material perform across different plants?

This analysis helped the management team prioritize vendor quality, identify operational inefficiencies, and optimize the supply chain for better performance.
